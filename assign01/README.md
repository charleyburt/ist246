To practice working with unsorted lists, write a program that composes random poetry. In particular, do the following:
 
Preparatory work:

Modify the SimpleSLL class (attached) to hold strings in its nodes instead of integers. Include the header file to enable the use of strings. 
Modify the SimpleSLL class to support a getRandom() method, which returns a randomly-chosen string from the list.

Application:

Read the words from the attached dictionary.txt file into a SimpleSLL object.

Prompt the user for a number of lines and number of words per line.Randomly pick words from the unsorted list to create a “poem” with the requested number of lines / words per line.

Prompt the user to see if they’d like to make another poem. 

A sample showing how the program should work is attached. Of course, your output will be different, since the words are chosen randomly. The specifications grading checklist for the assignment is also attached.
The code for your assignment is due no later than 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, 9/6/2017.
