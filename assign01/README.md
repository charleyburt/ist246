Attached to this assignment you will find a plain text file containing all of the winning Powerball lottery numbers from 11/1/1997 to 8/12/2015. Your task is to write a C++ program to perform some simple analysis on this data set.

Powerball lottery balls are numbered from 1 to 59 (inclusive), and in each drawing, six balls are chosen. The file has one line, with six integers, for each drawing. 

Write a program that reads input from the file. After all of the numbers have been read, the program should output the number of times each number (1, 2, …, 59) occurred in the data set. The results you should see are also attached to this assignment, as a second plain text file. Note: the output should be one result per line, formatted like this:

i:\tn

where i is the number (1, 2, …, 59), \t is the tab character, and n is the number of times the ball i was seen in the input file.

A starter program and makefile are also attached to this assignment to get you started. 

Your program will be evaluated according to the attached specifications grading checklist. The assignment is due NLT 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, 8/30/2017.
